These are a series of small tools I wrote to demonstrate some of the
functionality within the framework.  The coding isn't the best, but gets the
job done.

Feel free to use the tools, and report and bugs you find to the issue tracker
at libforensics.com.

- datedecoder.py: decodes various timestamp formats
- info2.py: lists the contents of INFO2 (recycle bin) files
- olecat.py: extracts streams from OLE files (Office documents, thumbs.db,
  etc.)
- oleinfo.py: dumps informatin from OLE files
- tdbcat.py: extracts thumbnail images from thumbs.db files
- tdbinfo.py: dumps information from thumbs.db files
- wmg.py: extracts metadata from Microsoft Word documents
